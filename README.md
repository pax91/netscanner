The script was developed on OSX Sonoma 14.3.1 with NMAP v7.92, should run on other OS versions with no problem, not tested!

### Description
The script ask you to create a new REPORT folder in user Desktop (or your custom location to be inputed) where put a folder into it named /params containing all the txt files for the script settings.
If you input an existing folder location, the script will use founded params to use in the script.
For every scan process, a new folder will be created into the main folder, containing NMAP reports plus a CUSTOM HTML report file (see Customization section).
After inputing the Target to be scanned, the script will perform a PING SCAN (nmap -sn option) to find all Live Hosts and create a TXT files with IP ADDRESSES LIST to be used on others scanning options as INPUT.

### Customization
For every scan procss executed, the script will create a folder containing the orignal NMAP reports plusa a CUSTOM REPORT named scan_report.html created from orginal NMAP HTML scan report file and adding custom css stylesheet.
