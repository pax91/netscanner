This option enables additional advanced and aggressive options. 
I haven´t decided exactly which it stands for yet. 
Presently this enables OS detection (-O), version scanning (-sV), 
script scanning (-sC) and traceroute (--traceroute).  
More features may be added in the future. The point is to enable 
a comprehensive set of scan options without people having to remember
a large set of flags.
However, because script scanning with the default set is considered 
intrusive, you should not use -A against target networks without 
permission. This option only enables features, and not timing options
(such as -T4) or verbosity options (-v) that you might want as well.
