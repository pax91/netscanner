TCP connect scan is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is 
 not an option. This is the case when a user does not have raw 
 packet privileges. 
 Instead of writing raw packets as most other scan types do, 
 Nmap asks the underlying operating system to establish a 
 connection with the target machine and port by issuing the 
 connect system call. 
 This is the same high-level system call that web browsers, 
 P2P clients, and most other network-enabled applications use 
 to establish a connection. 
 It is part of a programming interface known as the Berkeley Sockets API. 
 Rather than read raw packet responses off the wire, 
 Nmap uses this API to obtain status information on each 
 connection attempt.
