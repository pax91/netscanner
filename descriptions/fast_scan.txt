Specifies that you wish to scan fewer ports than the default. 
Normally Nmap scans the most common 1,000 ports for each scanned 
protocol. With -F, this is reduced to 100.

Nmap needs an nmap-services file with frequency information in 
order to know which ports are the most common. 
If port frequency information isn´t available, perhaps because 
of the use of a custom nmap-services file, -F means to scan only 
ports that are named in the services file (normally Nmap scans 
all named ports plus ports 1–1024).
