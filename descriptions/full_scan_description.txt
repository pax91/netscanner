This option enables additional advanced and aggressive options. 
 Presently this enables OS detection (-O), version scanning (-sV), 
 script scanning (-sC) and traceroute (--traceroute). 
 More features may be added in the future. 
 The point is to enable a comprehensive set of scan options without 
 people having to remember a large set of flags. 
 However, because script scanning with the default set is considered intrusive, 
 you should not use -A against target networks without permission. 
 This option only enables features, and not timing options (such as -T4) or 
 verbosity options (-v) that you might want as well. 
 Options which require privileges (e.g. root access) such as OS detection 
 and traceroute will only be enabled if those privileges are available.
