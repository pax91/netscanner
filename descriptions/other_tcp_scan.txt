These three scan types exploit a subtle loophole in the TCP RFC 
 to differentiate between open and closed ports. 
 Page 65 of RFC 793 says that “if the [destination] port state 
 is CLOSED .... an incoming segment not containing a RST causes a RST 
 to be sent in response.” Then the next page discusses packets 
 sent to open ports without the SYN, RST, or ACK bits set, stating that: 
 “you are unlikely to get here, but if you do, drop the segment, and return.”
 When scanning systems compliant with this RFC text, any packet not 
 containing SYN, RST, or ACK bits will result in a returned RST if the port 
 is closed and no response at all if the port is open. 
 As long as none of those three bits are included, any combination of the
 other three (FIN, PSH, and URG) are OK. 
 Nmap exploits this with three scan types:

     Null scan (-sN)
     Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)

     FIN scan (-sF)
     Sets just the TCP FIN bit.

     Xmas scan (-sX)
     Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like 
     a Christmas tree.

 These three scan types are exactly the same in behavior except for the 
 TCP flags set in probe packets. 
 If a RST packet is received, the port is considered closed, 
 while no response means it is open|filtered. 
 The port is marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable error 
 (type 3, code 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received.
