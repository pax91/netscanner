SYN scans, also known as “Half-Open” or “Stealth Scan” are an 
improvement over the previous method. In the previous method where 
we were sending back a TCP packet with the ACK flag set after receiving 
an SYN/ACK packet, now we would be sending an RST packet. This prevents 
the server from repeatedly trying to make the requests and massively 
reduces scan times.

This method is an improvement on the previous ones because:

They are faster
They might be able to bypass some primitive firewalls
Often, SYN Scans are not logged by applications running on the ports 
as most applications start logging a connection only after it has been 
fully established which is not the case with SYN Scans
However, it is not advisable to run SYN Scans on production environments 
as it might break certain unstable applications. It is also to be noted 
that SYN scans also require sudo privileges because it needs to craft 
raw packets.

Infact, when run with sudo privileges, nmap defaults to SYN Scans, 
otherwise it defaults to TCP scan.
