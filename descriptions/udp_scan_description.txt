While most popular services on the Internet run over the TCP protocol, 
 UDP services are widely deployed. 
 DNS, SNMP, and DHCP (registered ports 53, 161/162, and 67/68) 
 are three of the most common. 
 Because UDP scanning is generally slower and more difficult than TCP, 
 some security auditors ignore these ports. 
 This is a mistake, as exploitable UDP services are quite common and 
 attackers certainly don't ignore the whole protocol. 
 Fortunately, Nmap can help inventory UDP ports.
