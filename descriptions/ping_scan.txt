This option tells Nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery, 
 and only print out the available hosts that responded to the host 
 discovery probes. 
 This is often known as a “ping scan”, 
 but you can also request that traceroute and NSE host scripts be run. 
 This is by default one step more intrusive than the list scan, 
 and can often be used for the same purposes. 
 It allows light reconnaissance of a target network without attracting 
 much attention. 
 Knowing how many hosts are up is more valuable to attackers 
 than the list provided by list scan of every single IP and host name.
 PING Scan will also create the IP LIST files to be used on 
 other Scan Options.
