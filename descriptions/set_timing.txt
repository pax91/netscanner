These templates allow the user to specify how aggressive they wish to be, 
while leaving Nmap to pick the exact timing values. 
The templates also make some minor speed adjustments for which fine-grained 
control options do not currently exist. For example, -T4 prohibits the 
dynamic scan delay from exceeding 10 ms for TCP ports and -T5 caps that 
value at 5 ms. Templates can be used in combination with fine-grained 
controls, and the granular options will override the general timing templates 
for those specific values. I recommend using -T4 when scanning reasonably 
modern and reliable networks. Keep that option 
(at the beginning of the command line) even when you add fine-grained 
controls so that you benefit from those extra minor
optimizations that it enables.
