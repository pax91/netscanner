SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reasons. 
 It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports 
 per second on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls. 
 It is also relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never 
 completes TCP connections. 
 SYN scan works against any compliant TCP stack rather than 
 depending on idiosyncrasies of specific platforms as Nmap's FIN/NULL/Xmas, 
 Maimon and idle scans do. 
 It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between 
 the open, closed, and filtered states.
