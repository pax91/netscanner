One of the most common Nmap usage scenarios is to scan an ethernet LAN. 
On most LANs, especially those using private address ranges granted 
by RFC 1918, 
the vast majority of IP addresses are unused at any given time. 
When Nmap tries to send a raw IP packet such as an ICMP echo request, 
the operating system must determine the destination hardware 
(ARP) address corresponding to the target IP so that it can address 
the ethernet frame properly.
