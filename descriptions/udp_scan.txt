UDP scans are much less reliable than the previous two as UDP connections 
are stateless by nature. This means that there’s no “feedback mechanism” 
like TCP. UDP works on the principle “Fire and Forget” which means that 
it sends packets directed to targets at certain ports and hopes that they 
would make it. 
This gives more emphasis on speed than quality. However, the lack 
of a feedback mechanism makes it difficult to identify open ports.

When an UDP packet is sent to a target port, there might be three scenarios:

Usually there is no response received in which case nmap marks the port 
as open|filtered. If no response is received yet, it sends another UDP 
packet to double check and if yet again no response is received, 
it marks the port as open|filtered and moves on
It might get a UDP response back which is very rare. In such a scenario, 
the port is marked open
If the port is closed and it receives an ICMP echo request back 
which signifies that the port is unreachable.
