In this type of scan, Nmap sends a TCP packet to a port with 
the SYN flag set. In this scenario two things can occur :

The target responds with an RST packet that signifies that the 
port is closed.
Target doesnâ€™t respond at all, probably due to a firewall dropping 
all incoming packets in which case the port will be considered filtered
The target responds back with a TCP packet with the SYN/ACK flags set 
which would signify that the port is open and then Nmap would respond 
with a TCP packet with the ACK flag set and hence would complete the 
TCP 3-way handshake.

This is not a very reliable scan technique as it is easy to configure
a firewall rule to respond back with RST packets or drop all incoming 
packets. Also this method is extremely slow as it waits for the entire 
TCP 3 way handshake.
